# Teabot

Based on https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5250153

The part that lifts and lowers the tea bag needs to be printed from the files at [](3d_models/).
In addition, the electronics are contained in a box made with a laser cutter and [](teabot_box.svg). There's a separate compartment for the 9V block battery to make the inside a bit cleaner and to make it easier to change the battery.
The code can be opened, compiled and uploaded using the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

Used parts:
- 1x Arduino Nano
- 1x Rotary knob with switch
- 1x Power switch
- 1x SSD1306 OLED 128x32 display
- 1x MG996R servo
- 8x M3 x 25mm screws
- 1x M3 x 18mm screw
- 9x M3 self locking nuts
- 1x alligator clip (with some heatshrink around the teeth)
- 1x 9v block battery + battery clip
